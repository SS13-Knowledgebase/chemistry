This grenade mix will burn through anyone, destroy masks and headwear, heat everyone and everything up in a huge fireball, and drag anyone and anything into it.

Much like the admin-nade that burns everything and everyone.

**Beaker 1:**\
****1 Part Oil\*\
1 Part Radium\
6 Parts Sulphuric Acid\
1 Part Ethanol\
1 Part Welding Fuel\
2 Parts Oxygen\
6 Parts Water\
1 Part Silicon

**Beaker 2:**\
****7 Parts Fluorine\
3 Parts Carbon\
1 Part Aluminium\
1 Part Iron\
2 Parts Stable Plasma\
1 Part Phosphorus\
1 Part Chlorine\
2 Part Potassium\
2 part Hydrogen

Please note that the order of the chemicals is VERY important. You want to make the chemicals in the order shown above, so, for example, the potassium doesn’t mix with water when activated. This is due to how SS13 loads chemicals, mixing them in a virtual beaker from the top of the list to the bottom.

\* If going with a large beaker’s full, just make oil, remove 10u to get 5u, and continue with the rest of the recipe.
