<summary><strong>Effects on the human body</strong></summary>

This grenade mix will mute everyone exposed to the smoke, turn them braindead, shut down their lungs, deal insane amounts of toxin damage, a little brute damage, and will literally give people a heart attack.

Very deadly, but in a more “quiet” way; They won’t even know they’re hurt.
