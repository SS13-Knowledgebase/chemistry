**Cryostylane**: _Cools down temperature, as long as there is enough oxygen to react with._

**Cryoxadone**: _It heals all types of damage very swiftly (except clone damage, which is healed very slowly), but only when in a very cold environment. Is more effective in colder environments._

**Oxygen (liquid)**: _Required for Cryostylane to function._
