<summary>Strategy</summary>

Digest as pill (50u) to gain superhuman speed, pretty much no stun-time, no pain. Makes your mood stable and neutral, and fights against brain damage. The perfect stimulant for prolonged combat. There’s **no** downsides to this chemical compound.\
\
With Crank and Happiness being so slow at metabolizing, you should only take a pill every 37 seconds. Otherwise, you'll be prone to addiction. If that isn't a worry, you can take 2 pills, MAX, every 37 seconds, or you’ll overdose.\
\
Warning: Addictions come with risk of dizziness, loss of motor functions, feeling faint, feeling disoriented, and may also lead to loss of life.
