<summary>Strategy</summary>

Use the quick-make guide to make the chems, then set the heater to way over 380 to quickly heat the chems.

Then, in the chem-master, filter, for a standard 15u syringe, the specified amount of cyanide and chloral hydrate into a beaker, for use in a syringe.

If youâ€™re using a piercing syringe (10u), filter 6.4u Cyanide instead.

You need at least 3.6u Chloral Hydrate to knock somebody out.

Use in syringe to sedate and kill.
