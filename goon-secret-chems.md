# Goon Secret Chems

### Secret chems:

Bombini: Bee, Martini, Gunfire, Bees' Knees&#x20;

Marteeny: Atrazine, Ants, Martini, Liquid Dark Matter, Helium, Energy Drink

Miasmosa: Mimosa, Miasma, Stabilizing Agent, Sex on the Beach, Mind Eraser, Holy Water, mix in a champagne flute that is decorated with an orange slice and umbrella, must have unionized trait. Add miasma last&#x20;

Perfect Grilled Cheese: Bread, Cheese, Mayonaise. Superheat to 470-500 kelvin.

Juggernaut: Styptic Powder, Silver Sulfadiazine, Salicylic acid, Morphine, Bo Jack Daniel's&#x20;

Omega Hairgrownium: Mutagen (stable or unstable), Space Drugs, Hairgrownium, Super Hairgrownium, Radium.&#x20;

Sea4: Honey, Black Powder, Chlorine Trifluoride, Sea Breeze, Thermite&#x20;

Deep-Fried Dabs: The physical manifestation of the very concept of fried foods (Place something in the deep fryer for VERY long), dabs (Buy a dabbing license with spacebux, dab, take a blood sample)&#x20;

Disguiseium: Ling blood, unstable mutagen, stable mutagen, capulettium plus, space cleaner&#x20;

Directed Nanites: Oil, Nanomachines, Omnizine, Synthetic Flesh&#x20;

Warp: Harmful Glitter, Gin and Sonic, Sorium, Mercury, Methamphetamine&#x20;

Crime: Methamphetamine, George Melonium, Organic Superlubricant, Tetrahydrocannabinol, Ethanol. Must be set to arrest by Beepsky or else the chemical will disappear when you prepare it.&#x20;

Sheltergrog: Water and rum. However, the mixture inside the container must be a specific shade of green in order for this to work. Otherwise, nothing will happen. The simplest way to get sheltergrog is to mix 1 part water, 1 part lime juice, and 1 part rum. One possible alternative recipe is 1 part water, 1 part rum, and 1 part unstable mutagen.

Crabby Party Secret Formula: Tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, salt, water. Heat to 374 kelvin.&#x20;

Sheltestgrog: 3 : 22.5 : 16.1 : 43.4 : 15 . 3 parts water, 22.5 parts rum, 16.1 parts sulfur, 43.4 parts unstable mutagen, 15 parts carbon. Must be this exact ratio.&#x20;

Medusa: Toxin, Capsaicin, E. Coli Bacteria, Chalk, Smoke Powder, Carbon&#x20;

English Breakfast: Make the refried beans dish, extract it into a beaker to get the refried beans reagent, mix with two parts cryostylane for every part refried beans to get beans, then add milk.&#x20;

Extreme Dabs: Dabs, Glowing Slurry, Meth, Crime, E-Drink&#x20;

Pure Dabs: Ex Dabs, Holy Water, Stabilizing Agent, Deep-Fried Dabs

Stable Bose-Einstein Macro Condensate: 13 parts voltagen, 7 parts Something, 3 parts Liquid Space-Time (Can be extracted from Einstein-Rosen Loaves.) . Temperature in the container must be at 0 kelvin.&#x20;

Something: Sorium + LDM

The cooling can be accomplished by chilling all reagents to as close to 0 kelvin as possible, mixing them together, then adding chilled cryostylane and oxygen.

Quark-Gluon Plasma: SBEMC at 6617 (?) kelvin. Reaction must take place within a closed container. My method is to use the following Chemicompiler script to heat up the SBEMC:

\+}>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\[>++++++++++++++++++<-]>'$\


Make the SBEMC into a pill, then feed it to a dead monkey (Make sure the monkey has no other reagents within it). Then, superheat 100U of nitrogen using the following script:

\+}>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\[>++++++++++++++++++<-]>'$

You cannot use igniter-clicking for this as the maximum temperature an igniter can reach has been capped.

Make a pill out of your nitrogen, then feed it to the same monkey. The new QGP effect will shock you and anyone near the reaction and teleport the victims into lots of electrified grilles.&#x20;
