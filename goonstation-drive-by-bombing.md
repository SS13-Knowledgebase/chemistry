# Goonstation Drive-by Bombing

**How to do:**

1. Get 250U of crushed up paper in a water cooler bottle and 50U in a beaker . How does one obtain so much paper, you ask? You simply go around the station and grab sheets of paper from paper bins, then use them on a beaker and click-drag the beaker onto a water cooler bottle to transfer.
2. Heat up with an igniter to make ash. Instead of paper, you can also just use oil.
3. Combine the ash in the beaker and the water cooler bottle with salt and heat up with an igniter to make 600U charcoal
4. Steal some handheld welding fuel tanks (5-6 total); they hold 400U each. Dump them out.
5. Transfer 120U charcoal into each.
6. Order some hydroponics nutrition crates from cargo.
7. Dump the three bottles of saltpetre in each crate into a fuel tank.&#x20;
8. Add 120U sulfur to each tank to make 360U gunpowder bombs in each fuel tank.&#x20;
9. Click each tank 11 times with an igniter to heat it to 185 Celsius.
10. When you are ready to start bombing targets, take a pill of your speed-boosting mixture of choice. Meth+energy drink is ideal, but meth alone will work (Though, with meth alone, you'll suffer injuries and loss of limbs doing this)
11. Click the gunpowder tank to light it, then run like hell using sprint immediately afterwards. Don't wait for the explosion, just run. The explosion will occur on the tile you lit the gunpowder, even if the container moved in the meantime (Thanks, shitcode) If you don't get blocked off or slip at the worst possible time, you'll survive and be able to do this until all bombs are expended.

Alternatively, you can get enough gunpowder for the bombs by making using the roundstart saltpetre and using the foam chem duplication trick to get enough for all five bombs (Takes forever that way though).

**How it works:**

On gooncode, there is a slight delay between when black powder reaches its ignition temperature and when it actually explodes. When it is time to explode, the explosion proc is called on the same tile on which the black powder reached ignition temperature, even if its container has moved in the time between it reaching ignition temperature and when it's supposed to explode. This trick essentially just boils down to "Heat black powder to ignition temperature, then get away as quickly as possible". This does not work on tgcode servers, where the game actually does account for movement of the gunpowder container in the time between ignition and explosion.
