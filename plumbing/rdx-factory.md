  This is a semi-small RDX factory that can scale in size easily if you need
  more boom. If you aren't using a full 4 Nitric chamber setup you will likely
  have to declog the peroxide to run optimally

# RDX Factory

![Here is an overview of the unmodified single nitric acid chamber](../.gitbook/assets/Overview.PNG) ![Here are the dispensers needed aswell as the temperature and volume of the heaters.](<../.gitbook/assets/named stuff.PNG>)

![Here are the reaction chambers and the acclimators to the main chambers. ](../.gitbook/assets/acclimators.PNG)

![Here are the filters set them up as shown ](../.gitbook/assets/filters.PNG)

![Here is the setup for the rdx maker itself as stabilizing agent and gold aren't used in the reaction you can save alot of space. Everyonce in a while there will be a dude reaction but it won't affect anything aside from taking some time to clear](../.gitbook/assets/update.PNG)

![Here is the layout of the Fluorosulfuric Acid, you should only need to create a second one of these every 4 nitric acid chambers](<../.gitbook/assets/flurosulphuric acid.PNG>) ![Here is the layout of the Nitric Acid, these are the main thing to increase to get faster RDX](<../.gitbook/assets/nitric acid.PNG>)

![Here is an example where the nitric acid chamber has been expanded by 1, this effectively doubles the speed at which RDX is made as its the main bottleneck](<../.gitbook/assets/example expanded.PNG>)
