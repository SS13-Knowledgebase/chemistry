# TaTP Factory



![Here is an overview of the factory we are building today it fitx in a 8x7 footprint so relatively compact](../.gitbook/assets/overview.PNG)

![One note is you need in insert a single unit of exotic stabilizer within the area, you can forgo that if you want it to mix inside your bomb but you will need to remove the heater and exotic stabilizer from the factory](<../.gitbook/assets/please do this.PNG>)
